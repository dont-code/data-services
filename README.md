## What is it for ?

These services store / load / list the data edited by users of a Dont-code application.
They are part of the [Dont-code](https://dont-code.net) no-code / low-code platform enabling you to quickly produce your very own application.

## What is it ?
These services are developed in [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) and uses a [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) database to store the data in json format.
By default, Dont-code provides two ways to store the data generated by any application:
- Either it is stored locally in the Browser (as IndexedDB), this is all managed client-side by the Previewer
- Or it is shareable hence sent to these services for a storage in MongoDb.

Please note Plugins can provide alternative ways for handling application's data.

## How is it working ?
Data services are just Rest Services using Quarkus RestEasy Reactive and Mongo Reactive

## How to build it ?
This project is a standard maven project:

1. Installing

   Download and Install [Maven](https://maven.org) if necessary.

   Download and Install a local [Mongo database](https://mongodb.com) if you want to run tests
   
   - You can define environment variable `_TEST_QUARKUS_MONGODB_PROJECTS_CONNECTION_STRING` to an existing mongodb if you want to override the default 'mongodb://localhost:27017' connection url during the test.
   - You can define environment variable `_DEV_QUARKUS_MONGODB_PROJECTS_CONNECTION_STRING` to an existing mongodb if you want to override the default 'mongodb://localhost:27017' connection url during the development.

2. Running tests

   `mvn test`

3. Building

   `mvn package` to produce the Uber Jar data-services-runner.jar
   
4. Running in dev mode enabling lib coding

   `mvn quarkus:dev` to start the services

   `http://localhost:8084` to access the homepage

4. Running in production mode

   `java -jar target/data-services-runner.jar`
